IPL Price Prediction refers to the use of data analytics and machine learning to estimate the auction price or market value of Indian Premier League (IPL) players. The prediction is based on multiple factors such as player performance statistics, past auction prices, role (batsman, bowler, all-rounder, wicketkeeper), age, experience, consistency, fitness, and recent form in domestic and international matches.

Historical IPL auction data is used to train models that learn patterns between player attributes and their selling price. Popular algorithms include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

This prediction helps franchises make informed bidding decisions, optimize budgets, and build balanced teams, while also providing insights for analysts and fans into player valuation trends.
